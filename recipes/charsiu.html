        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>"Char siu" literally means "fork roast"—"char" being "fork" (both noun and verb) and "siu" being "roast"—after the traditional cooking method for the dish: long strips of seasoned boneless pork are skewered with long forks and placed in a covered oven or over a fire. This is best cooked over charcoal, but it's important to cook with indirect heat.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pork tenderloins</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
            <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Chinese rice wine</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red rood coloring (optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut pork with the grain into strips 1 1/2- to 2-inches long; put into a large resealable plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Stir soy sauce, honey, ketchup, brown sugar, rice wine, hoisin sauce, red food coloring or red bean curd (see Cook's Note), and Chinese five-spice powder together in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until just combined and slightly warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the marinade into the bag with the pork, squeeze air from the bag, and seal. Turn bag a few times to coat all pork pieces in marinade.</li>
            <li>Marinate pork in refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove pork from marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Cook pork on preheated grill for 20 minutes. Put a small container of water onto the grill and continue cooking, turning the pork regularly, until cooked through, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
